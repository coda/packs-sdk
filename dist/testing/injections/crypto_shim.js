// esbuild isn't injecting the shim exports into global. in this particular case, crypto 
// library is usually used as global.crypto which returns undefined otherwise. 
// 
// alternatively a few other approaches are tried:
// - shim global: which doesn't work with VM somehow since the VM manages context.global which 
//   seems a different object from the global here. causing manifest to be undefined.
// - use esbuild define global.crypto: crypto. didn't work. 
// - https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/296 Didn't work since we banned eval in VM.
//
// Lastly, we can move this shim to thunk bundle and register it into global from the thunk bundle.
// It has the same side effect of the shim though. 
//
// please note that this causes a global leak and needs be ignored in some configs.
