Packs have native support for accepting images and files as parameters and returning them as results, always passed as URLs. Packs can either return a "live" URL to a hosted image (`ImageReference`) or a temporary URL that Coda should upload the doc (`ImageAttachment`). The utility provided at `content.temporaryBlobStorage` can be used to save private images to a temporary location for later upload, which can be used in conjunction with the `ImageAttachment` hint type to permanently ingest an image resource using the temporary URL. Packs also provide support for embedded SVGs, including support for dark mode.
