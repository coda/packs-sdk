Communicating with an API or external server is done through the `Fetcher`, a custom interface for making HTTP requests. The fetcher is made available through the `context` object passed in to formulas. The fetcher can only send requests to URLs that have have a domain name that's been registered using `addNetworkDomain`. The fetcher runs asynchronously, and is typically run within an `async` function that will `await` the result.
