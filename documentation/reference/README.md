# Pack SDK Reference

Explore these reference docs to learn more about the specific interfaces that make up the Pack SDK. Use the search box at the top of the page to quickly find the function or type you are looking for.

This reference documentation is automatically generated from TypeScript definitions, and as such uses terminology that may be unfamiliar. While the reference docs are an important resource, if you are new to the platform it may be best to start with the [guides][guides] which explain the concepts more wholistically.

## Modules

The majority of the SDK is in the [Core module][module_core], which contains all the functions and types you'll use to define and build your Pack. This is what's imported as `coda` in the sample code shown throughout this documentation.

The [Testing module][module_testing] contains utilities that aid in writing unit tests and integration tests for Packs, and are only available when developing locally using the CLI. Learn more about how to utilize these functions in the [Testing guide][testing].
