This Pack acts as an integration with Todoist, and creates:

- 3 buttons
  - addProject , which creates a new Project with a given title
  - addTask , which creates a new task with the given content , and adds it to an optional Project (by default, this goes into your Inbox)
  - markAsComplete , which closes out a given task based on its taskID
- 2 sync tables
  - Projects syncs all of the user’s Projects
  - Tasks syncs all of the user’s active tasks, across all projects

Note this Pack requires a free Todoist account. The API key needed can be accessed from the “Integrations” tab within Settings.
