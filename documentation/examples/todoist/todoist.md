This Pack provides an integration with the task tracking app [Todoist][todoist]. It uses a variety of building blocks to allow users to work with their projects and tasks, including:

- Formulas that provide rich data about an item given its URL.
- Column formats that automatically apply those formulas to matching URLs.
- Action formulas that create and update items, for use in button and automations.
- Sync tables for pulling in all of the user's items.

The Pack uses OAuth2 to connect to a user's Todoist account, which you can create for free.
