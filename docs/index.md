# Build Packs for Coda

A Pack is an extension that adds new powers to your doc. Packs work by supplementing the core building blocks of Coda, so you can customize how your doc looks, works, and integrates.

## :material-toy-brick-outline: Let’s build building blocks together.

With a little JavaScript, anyone can create and publish a Pack to the Gallery. All you need to do is write the code and Coda will deploy and host the Pack for you.

Packs can be created for personal use, shared with a team, or published to the world. Everything from simple utilities to rich integrations can be built with Packs.

In this snippet from a recent webinar we demonstrate how to build a Pack from scratch that retrieves your task list from Todoist :simple-todoist:. It was created in under 10 minutes and with less than 30 lines of code in the Pack Studio.
