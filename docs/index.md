# Build Packs for Coda

<section class="landing-row" markdown>

## :material-toy-brick-outline: Letâ€™s build building blocks together.

A Pack is an extension that adds new powers to your doc. Packs work by supplementing the core building blocks of Coda, so you can customize how your doc looks, works, and integrates.

With a little JavaScript, anyone can create and publish a Pack to the Gallery. All you need to do is write the code and Coda will deploy and host the Pack for you.
