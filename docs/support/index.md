# How to get help

We use a mixture of different platforms to provide support to Pack makers, so review the options below to determine the best way to get help.



## Questions or advice

For general questions about Packs, or advice on how to build them, we recommend you post in the [Coda Community "Making Packs" category][community_packs]. Codans actively monitor the community and answer questions, as well as other Pack makers that have experience with the platform. Posting questions and answers in a public forum helps build up a knowledge base of information that helps everyone.

    <input type="text" name="q" id="q" value="#making-packs " class="md-input md-input--stretch"/>

    <button type="submit" class="md-button">Search existing questions</button>
    <a href="https://community.coda.io/new-topic?category=making-packs" class="md-button md-button--primary">Post a new question</a>
  </p>
</form>


## Problems or bugs

If you are experiencing a problem with your Pack or have identified a bug you can reach out to the Coda Partners team. Send an email to [partners@coda.io][partners_email], and include the following information:

- The URL of your Pack in the Pack Studio.
- The URL of a doc where the error occurred (make sure to [share it with support][hc_share]).
- Any relevant error messages or snippets of code.

## Request multiple network domains {: #network-domains}

By default all Packs are limited to only a single [network domain][fetcher_network_domains]. To request an exemption, please fill out the form linked below. Ensure you are signed in with the same Coda account you are using to develop the Pack. We'll review your request and respond with a decision within a few business days.
