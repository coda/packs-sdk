# Get started in the browser

The fastest and easiest way to create a Pack is to use our web-based Pack Studio. You don't need to download any code or tools, just make sure you have:

1. A Coda account, with
2. [Doc Maker access][hc_doc_maker] in your workspace.

If you're new to Coda, [sign up][coda_sign_up] for a free account and you'll automatically be made a Doc Maker in your personal workspace.


## Navigate to the Pack Studio

The Pack Studio is built right in to the Coda application. To get there:

1. Open [Coda][coda_home] in your browser.
1. Click on **Packs** in the navigation menu on the left. If you are a member of multiple workspaces you will need to select a workspace first.
1. Click the **Create a Pack** button in the upper right.

You are now in the Pack Studio, ready to start building!

## Create a Pack from an example

When starting a new Pack you have the choice to begin with an existing example or or start from scratch. In this tutorial we'll use the basic [Hello World][samples_hello_world] sample code. Take a moment to read through the code and comments and get an understanding of how a Pack is structured.

Next we'll use the Pack Studio to build that code and get it ready to use:

1. Click on the **Hello World** example to add in the sample code.

1. Click on the Pack name **Untitled Pack** in the upper left, and change it to "Hello World".

1. Click the **Build** button in the bottom left.

    This checks your Pack for errors and Packages it up for use in a Coda doc. It can take a few seconds for the build to complete.

1. When the confirmation screen appears, click **Create a test doc**.

Your Pack is now built and ready to use!

## Use the Pack

The Pack can now be installed in any of your docs, and the test doc you created comes with the Pack pre-installed. Now let's use your new Pack in the document.

## Update the Pack

Now that you have your Pack up and running let's make a change to how it works.

1. Back in the Pack Studio, update your code to say "Howdy" instead of "Hello":

    ```ts hl_lines="2"
    execute: async function ([name]) {
        return "Howdy " + name + "!";
    },
    ```

1. Click the **Build** button again to rebuild your Pack with this change.
1. When the Build has completed, switch back to your test document.

    You'll notice that the formula is still returning `Hello World!`, and that's because formulas aren't automatically recalculated when you update your Pack code.
