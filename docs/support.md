# How to get help

We use a mixture of different platforms to provide support to Pack makers, so review the options below to determine the best way to get help.



## Questions or advice

For general questions about Packs, or advice on how to build them, we recommend you post in the [Coda Community "Packs" category][community_packs]. Codans actively monitor the community and answer questions, as well as other Pack makers that have experience with the platform. Posting questions and answers in a public forum helps build up a knowledge base of information that helps everyone.

  </p>
</form>


## Problems or bugs

If you are experiencing a problem with your Pack or have identified a bug you can reach out to the Coda Partners team. Send an email to [parnters@coda.io][partners_email], and include the following information:

- The URL of your Pack in the Pack Studio.
- The URL of a doc where the error occurred (make sure to [share it with support][hc_share]).
- Any relevant error messages or snippets of code.
