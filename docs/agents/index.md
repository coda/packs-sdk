# Build agents for {{ custom.agent_product_name }}

{{ custom.agent_product_name }} is the AI assistant that works everywhere you work and helps before you even ask. You can use it to interact with agent, AI collaborators built for specific workflows. It includes a powerful set of default agents and the ability to build custom ones.

We are enabling developers like you to leverage our 16+ years of investment in AI, to build and deploy your own agents quickly. We offer some key value propositions:

- **Ubiquity & Distribution** - Your agent will work on 500k websites and apps right out of the box, meeting your users where they actually work with over 40M daily active users, including 50,000 teams and one-third of the Fortune 500.
- **Data & actions** - With 800+ existing integrations in our platform, your agents can easily take actions in these apps as well as quickly retrieve data, pre-indexed and permission-aware.
- **Enterprise-readiness** - The platform provides the security, compliance, and controls that Enterprise companies require, leaving you more time to focus on delivering value.

## Agents extend Coda Packs

Agents are built on the Coda Pack platform. Coda was acquired by Grammarly in 2025, and Packs are a plugin system for Coda. While most of the features in the Packs platform were initially created to enhance Coda Docs, they were turned out to be a great foundation for building agents as well.

You'll see the word "Pack" all throughout this definition, and you can think of it as interchangeable with "agent". Building an agent involves creating a Pack with a specific set of features and then enabling it to run in {{ custom.agent_product_name }}.
