# Index content into the knowledge layer

LLMs have a limited context window, which is how much text they can consider at once. This can make it challenging to give your agent access to all the data it needs, which can be much larger. One approach is RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), where the LLM first retrieves records relevant to the userâ€™s query, and then generates a response using those records.

The {{ custom.agent_product_name }} platform provides a built-in RAG system we call the knowledge layer. You write some code in your agent to sync in the records, and Grammarly will chunk it, store it in a vector database, and expose a search tool to your agent. See the [Tools guide][tools_knowledge] for more information on how to connect indexed knowledge to a skill.


## When to use it

An agent may work with many different types of records, but indexing may not be appropriate for all of them. Indexing works best for record types that have:

- Contain significant text content that the user will want to search over.
- Have user-visible URLs that the user would want to click into.

Indexing a blog post or draft email makes sense, but indexing quarterly sales numbers does not.


## Powered by sync tables

Sync tables are a Packs building block that allow you pull in long lists of records from external sources. They are primarily composed of a schema that defines the structure of the data and a sync formula that makes the requests and transforms the data. You can read more about how to create a sync table in the [Sync tables guide][sync_tables].

To setup indexing, create a sync table for each record type you want to index. You'll need to ensure that the schema includes some required metadata, which you can read about in the [Schema changes guide][indexing_schemas]. You can improve the data freshness by implementing [Incremental sync][incremental] and simplify the user set by implementing [crawling][crawling].
