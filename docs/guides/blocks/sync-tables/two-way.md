# Enable edits on sync tables

!!! warning "Limited alpha"
    This feature is currently only available to a limited group of alpha testers. Email [partners@coda.io](mailto:partners@coda.io) to learn more and request access.

[Sync tables][sync_tables] allow you to pull in data from external applications and sources, but by default these tables are read-only. You can make your sync tables more useful by supporting two-way sync, where you allow users to edit the cell values and push the changes back to the data source.

## Using two-way sync

To enable two-way sync on a sync table that supports it you need to toggle on the option **Enable Edits** in the sync table settings. Doing so reveals additional options that control when updates are sent and which account is used.

<img src="../../../../images/two_way_enable.png" srcset="../../../../images/two_way_enable_2x.png 2x" class="screenshot" alt="Enabling edits on a sync table.">

Certain columns of the table will now be editable, and you can change cell values them as you would for a normal Coda table. Use the **Update rows** link to push the changes back to the data source.

## Adding two-way sync

You can add support for two-way sync to any sync table, even after it's published. You'll have to adjust the schema used by your sync table and add a function to handle the updates.


### Annotate the schema

Not every field that you sync from the external data source can be changed. To indicate which columns should be editable you need to annotate your schema by adding `mutable: true` to the corresponding properties.

```{.ts hl_lines="7"}
const TaskSchema = coda.makeObjectSchema({
  properties: {
    name: {
      description: "The name of the task.",
      type: coda.ValueType.String,
      fromKey: "content",
      mutable: true,
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});
```

Only top-level properties in the schema are eligible to be editable, since they are stored in distinct columns. Properties in nested objects, even if marked as mutable, will not be editable in the sync table. You can however still make a column containing an nested object editable, but you'll need to provide [an options function](#options) to generate a list of compatible objects.

??? tip "Annotating a shared schema"

    If the property's schema is reused in multiple columns, and only some of those are editable, you can use the [object spread operator][mdn_spread_object] to duplicate the schema and merge in the `mutable` field.

    ```{.ts hl_lines="10-13"}
    const UserSchema = coda.makeObjectSchema({
      // ...
    });

    const TaskSchema = coda.makeObjectSchema({
      properties: {
        // The creator cannot be edited.
        creator: UserSchema,
        // The assignee can be edited.
        assignee: {
          ...UserSchema,
          mutable: true,
        },
        // ...
      },
      // ...
    });
    ```


### Write the update function

Once the user has made their edits you'll need to figure out how to push them back to the external data source. This code is implemented in the `executeUpdate` function, which lives alongside the `execute` function in the sync formula.

```{.ts hl_lines="9-11"}
pack.addSyncTable({
  name: "Tasks",
  // ...
  formula: {
    // ...
    execute: async function (args, context) {
      // Pull down the data ...
    },
    executeUpdate: async function (args, updates, context) {
      // Push up the changes and return the updated data...
    },
  },
});
```

Much like the `execute` function, the `executeUpdate` function receives the sync table's parameter values and the execution context. However it is also provided an array of `updates` which contain information about the rows being updated.

Each [`SyncUpdate`][reference_sync_update] object in the array contains the previous value for that row, the new value, and the list of fields that were updated. By default the `executeUpdate` function only receives one row at a time, but this can be increased for APIs that support [batching](#batching).

Use those values to make the API requests needed to update the external data source, and then return the final value for the updated row. This may differ from what the user entered if the update had side effects, for example increasing the last updated timestamp of the record.

```ts
executeUpdate: async function (args, updates, context) {
  let update = updates[0];  // Only one row at a time, by default.
  let task = update.newValue;

  // Update the task in Todoist.
  let response = await context.fetcher.fetch({
    method: "POST",
    url: `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks/${task.id}`,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(task),
  });

  // Return the final state of the task.
  let updated = response.body;
  return {
    result: [updated],
  };
},
```

??? tip "Getting the final row value"

    For many APIs getting the final row value is easy, as the updated record is returned in the API response. In cases where the updated record isn't returned in the response you can immediately fetch it to get the final state.

    ```ts
    let task = update.newValue;
    await updateTask(task);
    let updated = await getTask(task.id);
    return {
      result: [updated],
    };
    ```

    This may not always be feasible however, as some APIs have a delay between when the update is made and when it's reflected in the API responses. In those cases you may have to return the value that the user entered, understanding that any side effects from the update won't be reflected.

    ```ts
    let task = update.newValue;
    await updateTask(task);
    return {
      result: [task],
    };
    ```


## Batching updates {: #batching}

By default row updates are processed one at a time, which makes the coding simple but can impact performance when many rows are being updated at once. You can greatly improve performance by batching multiple updates into a single `executeUpdate` call and processing them in parallel.

The batch size can be adjusted by setting the `maxUpdateBatchSize` field of the sync formula. You'll also need to adjust your `executeUpdate` function to be able to handle multiple updates at once. Use a batch update endpoint if your API provides one, or if not make fetch requests [in parallel][fetcher_parallel] to realize performance gains.

??? tip "Selecting a batch size"

    A single execution of the `executeUpdate` function can run for at most 60 seconds, after which it will be killed and the update will fail. To allow for variability in network and server conditions it's best to set a target of 30 seconds or less for each batch. How many rows that equates to depends heavily on the API being used and the number of requests it takes to update a row, and some experimentation may be required to find an ideal size.

```ts
pack.addSyncTable({
  // ...
  formula: {
    // ...
    maxUpdateBatchSize: 10,
    executeUpdate: async function (args, updates, context) {
      // Create an async job for each update.
      let jobs = updates.map(async update => {
        let response = await context.fetcher.fetch({
          // Update request details ...
        });
        return response.body;
      });
      // Wait for all of the jobs to finish .
      let completed = await Promise.allSettled(jobs);

      // For each update, return either the updated row or an error if the
      // update failed.
      let results = completed.map(job => {
        if (job.status === "fulfilled") {
          return job.value;
        } else {
          return job.reason;
        }
      });
      return {
        result: results,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

When processing updates in batches be sure to return the same number of results as there were updates, in the same order. If an individual update fails, catch the exception and return it in the results array to indicate that the row update failed. Unhandled exceptions will prevent the entire batch from completing and won't give the user a clear indication of which row was the cause. See the [Handling errors](#handling-errors) section below for more information.


## Property options {: #options}

Similar to [parameter autocomplete][parameters_autocomplete], you can provide a suggested set of options for mutable properties, which will be shown to the user when they are editing a corresponding cell.

<img src="../../../../images/two_way_autocomplete.png" srcset="../../../../images/two_way_autocomplete_2x.png 2x" class="screenshot" alt="Suggested property options in a cell.">

!!! info "The hint `SelectList` or `Reference` is required"

    Suggested options is only available for properties that have the `codaType` set to `SelectList` or `Reference`. In the future the `SelectList` hint will also change the UX of the column to be like a Coda select list.

 The possible choices are defined in the `options` field of the property, which can be either an array of static values or a function that generates them dynamically. An options function can access the value of other properties in the row via `context.propertyValues` and the current search string typed by the user via `context.search`.



```ts
const ShirtSchema = coda.makeObjectSchema({
  properties: {
    size: {
      type: coda.ValueType.String,
      codaType: coda.ValueHintType.SelectList,
      options: ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],
    },
    color: {
      type: coda.ValueType.String,
      codaType: coda.ValueHintType.SelectList,
      options: async function (context) {
        let size = context.propertyValues.size;
        let availableColors = await getColorsForSize(context, size);
        return availableColors;
      },
    },
    pattern: {
      type: coda.ValueType.String,
      codaType: coda.ValueHintType.SelectList,
      options: async function (context) {
        let search = context.search;
        let patterns = await searchPatterns(context, search);
        return patterns;
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

For sync tables with dynamic schemas, you aren't able to define the options function directly on the property itself. Instead use the special value `OptionsType.Dynamic`, which tells Coda to call the sync table's `propertyOptions` function. This is a single function that handles the option generating for all dynamic properties. It's defined directly on a dynamic sync table, or within the `dynamicOptions` of a regular sync table. The function can determine which property to provide options for by inspecting `context.propertyName`.

<!-- TODO: Document exactly what propertyName contains (original, normalized, fromKey). -->

=== "Dynamic sync table"

    ```ts
    pack.addDynamicSyncTable({
      // ...
      getSchema: async function (context) {
        let attributes = await getCustomAttributes(context);
        for (let attr of attributes) {
          properties[attr] = {
            // ...
            codaType: coda.ValueHintType.SelectList,
            options: coda.OptionsType.Dynamic,
          }
        }
        // ...
      },
      propertyOptions: async function (context) {
        let attr = context.propertyName;
        let options = await getCustomAttributeOptions(context, attr);
        return options;
      },
    });
    ```

=== "Regular sync table"

    ```ts
    pack.addSyncTable({
      // ...
      dynamicOptions: {
        getSchema: async function (context) {
          // ...
          let attributes = await getCustomAttributes(context);
          for (let attr of attriutes) {
            properties[attr] = {
              // ...
              codaType: coda.ValueHintType.SelectList,
              options: coda.OptionsType.Dynamic,
            }
          }
          // ...
        },
        propertyOptions: async function (context) {
          let attr = context.propertyName;
          let options = await getCustomAttributeOptions(context, attr);
          return options;
        },
      },
    });
    ```


## Handling errors

When a row fails to update Coda will show an error message attached to that row. The pending edits will be retained, so that users can adjust them and try again.

<img src="../../../../images/two_way_error.png" srcset="../../../../images/two_way_error_2x.png 2x" class="screenshot" alt="Error attached to a row.">

To associate an error with a row return it at the corresponding index in the `result` array. For tables that use single row updates (`maxUpdateBatchSize == 1`) if you throw a `UserVisibleError` it will be associated with the row automatically. In all other cases a thrown error will be treated as a failure of the entire sync and cancel any remaining row updates.
