# How to troubleshoot your code

## Logging

You can log messages using the standard JavaScript logging method, `console.log()`.

```ts
let response = context.fetcher.fetch({
  method: "GET",
  url: "https://api.example.com/items"
});
let items = response.body.items;
console.log("Retrieved %s items.", items.length);
```

When executing a Pack locally these logs will be written to the console, and when run in a doc they will be visible in the [Pack maker tools][pmt]. This can be useful for debugging during development as well as in production.

The Packs runtime only includes a subset of the [full `console` methods][mdn_console], specifically:

- `console.debug()`
- `console.error()`
- `console.info()`
- `console.log()`
- `console.trace()`
- `console.warn()`


## Common errors

### Domain doesn't resolve to a public IP

- `The given domain <domain> does not resolve to a public IP`

This error indicates that the domain you provided in an `addNetworkDomain()` call doesn't resolved to an accessible IP address. This could be due to a typo in the domain name. However there are some cases where a service assigns IP addresses to subdomains (`foo.example.com`) but not the root domain you are trying to add (`example.com`). If that is the case, either add the subdomain or [contact support][support] to have the root domain manually added to your Pack.


### Missing required developer tooling

- `Error: not found: make`
- `g++: Permission denied`

These errors can occur when installing the SDK locally, specifically during the installation of the `isolated-vm` dependency. They indicate that certain required developer tools are not present on the machine. See the [help documentation][isolated_vm_requirements] for this library for more information on how to install these missing packages on your machine.


### Invalid action

- `Unable to execute invalid action`

This error will appear at the bottom of the screen after pressing a button, and indicates that the formula used in the button isn't a valid action. In order for a formula to be used as an action within a button, it must be defined with `isAction: true`. See the [Actions guide][actions_create] for more information.


### HTTP response too large

<!-- https://golinks.io/bug/22358 -->

- `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Received message larger than max`

This error indicates that a fetcher request got back a response that is larger than the Packs runtime allows. If you are querying an external API for records, see if you can use a limit or paging parameter to get back a smaller response. If you need to work with large files you'll need to build an application outside of Packs that processes them. If you only need a small increase in the size limit you can [contact support][support] to request an adjustment.
