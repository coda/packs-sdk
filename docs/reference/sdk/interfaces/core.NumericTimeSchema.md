# Interface: NumericTimeSchema

[core](../modules/core.md).NumericTimeSchema

A schema representing a return value or object property that is provided as a number,
which Coda should interpret as a time. The given number should be in seconds since the Unix epoch.
While this is a full datetime, only the time component will be rendered, so the date used is irrelevant.
