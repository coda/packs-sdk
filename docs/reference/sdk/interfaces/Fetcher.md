# Interface: Fetcher

A utility that allows you to make HTTP requests from a pack. The fetcher also
handles applying user authentication credentials to each request, if applicable.

This is only way a pack is able to make HTTP requests, as using other libraries is unsupported.

## Methods

### fetch

â–¸ **fetch**<`T`\>(`request`): `Promise`<[`FetchResponse`](FetchResponse.md)<`T`\>\>

Makes an HTTP request.

If authentication is used with this pack, the user's secret credentials will be
automatically applied to the request (whether in the HTTP headers, as a URL parameter,
or whatever the authentication type dictates). Your invocation of `fetch()` need not
deal with authentication in any way, Coda will handle that entirely on your behalf.
