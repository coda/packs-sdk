# Enumeration: TokenExchangeCredentialsLocation

[core](../modules/core.md).TokenExchangeCredentialsLocation

Where to pass the client credentials (client ID and client secret) when making the OAuth2 token
exchange request. Used in [credentialsLocation](../interfaces/core.OAuth2Authentication.md#credentialslocation).

## Enumeration Members

### AuthorizationHeader

• **AuthorizationHeader** = ``"AuthorizationHeader"``

The credentials are passed in the Authorization header using the `Basic` scheme.

___

### Automatic

• **Automatic** = ``"Automatic"``

Allow Coda to determine this automatically. Currently that means Coda tries passing the
credentials in the body first, and if that fails then tries passing them in the Authorization
header.

___

### Body

• **Body** = ``"Body"``

The credentials are passed in the body of the request, encoded as
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` along with the other parameters.
