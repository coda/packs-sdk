# Interface: ScaleSchema

A schema representing a return value or object property that is a number that should
be rendered as a scale.

A scale is a widget with a repeated set of icons, where the number of shaded represents
a numeric value. The canonical example of a scale is a star rating, which might show
5 star icons, with 3 of them shaded, indicating a value of 3.
