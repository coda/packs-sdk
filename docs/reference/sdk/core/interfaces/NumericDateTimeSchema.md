# Interface: NumericDateTimeSchema

A schema representing a return value or object property that is provided as a number,
which Coda should interpret as a datetime. The given number should be in seconds since the Unix epoch.

## Extends

## Properties

### codaType

> **codaType**: [`DateTime`](../enumerations/ValueHintType.md#datetime)

#### Overrides

`BaseNumberSchema.codaType`

***

### dateFormat?

> `optional` **dateFormat**: `string`

Only applies when this is used as a sync table property.

***

### description?

> `optional` **description**: `string`

### timeFormat?

> `optional` **timeFormat**: `string`

A Moment time format string, such as 'HH:mm:ss', that corresponds to a supported Coda time column format,
