# Interface: PropertyIdentifierDetails

An identifier for a schema property for specifying labels along with the reference to the property.
This is useful for specifying a label for a property reference that uses a json path, where the
label of the underlying property might not be descriptive enough at the top-level object.

## Properties

### label?

> `optional` **label**: `string`

An optional label for the property. This will be used in locations where the label appears with the property.

If set to '', the label will be omitted.

***

### placeholder?

> `optional` **placeholder**: `string`

An optional placeholder value, which will be rendered when the property value is an empty value
(null, undefined, "", [], {}). This will be used in the Pack card title, subtitle, and snippet.
Not accessible within the Coda formula language.

***

### property

> **property**: `string`

The value of the property to reference. Can be either an exact property name or a json path.
