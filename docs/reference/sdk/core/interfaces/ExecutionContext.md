# Interface: ExecutionContext

An object passed to the `execute` function of every formula invocation
with information and utilities for handling the invocation. In particular,
this contains the [core.Fetcher](Fetcher.md), which is used for making HTTP requests.

## Extended by

- [`SyncExecutionContext`](SyncExecutionContext.md)
- [`UpdateSyncExecutionContext`](UpdateSyncExecutionContext.md)
- [`MockExecutionContext`](../../testing/interfaces/MockExecutionContext.md)

## Properties

### endpoint?

> `readonly` `optional` **endpoint**: `string`

The base endpoint URL for the user's account, only if applicable. See
[core.BaseAuthentication.requiresEndpointUrl](BaseAuthentication.md#requiresendpointurl).

If the API URLs are variable based on the user account, you will need this endpoint
to construct URLs to use with the fetcher. Alternatively, you can use relative URLs
(e.g. "/api/entity") and Coda will include the endpoint for you automatically.

***

### fetcher

> `readonly` **fetcher**: [`Fetcher`](Fetcher.md)

The [core.Fetcher](Fetcher.md) used for making HTTP requests.

***

### invocationLocation

> `readonly` **invocationLocation**: [`InvocationLocation`](InvocationLocation.md)

Information about the Coda environment and doc this formula was invoked from.
This is mostly for Coda internal use and we do not recommend relying on it.

***

### invocationToken

> `readonly` **invocationToken**: `string`

A random token scoped to only this request invocation.
This is a unique identifier for the invocation, and in particular used with
[core.AuthenticationType.Custom](../enumerations/AuthenticationType.md#custom) for naming template parameters that will be
replaced by the fetcher in secure way.

***

### sync?

> `readonly` `optional` **sync**: [`Sync`](../type-aliases/Sync.md)\<`unknown`, `unknown`, `unknown`\>

Information about state of the current sync. Only populated if this is a sync table formula.

***

### temporaryBlobStorage

> `readonly` **temporaryBlobStorage**: [`TemporaryBlobStorage`](TemporaryBlobStorage.md)

A utility to fetch and store files and images that either require the pack user's authentication
or are too large to return inline. See [core.TemporaryBlobStorage](TemporaryBlobStorage.md).

***

### timezone

> `readonly` **timezone**: `string`

The timezone of the doc from which this formula was invoked.
