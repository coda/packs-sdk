# Interface: SyncFormulaResult\<K, L, SchemaT, ContextT, PermissionsContextT\>

The return value from the formula that implements a sync table. Each sync formula invocation
returns one reasonable size page of results. The formula may also return a continuation, indicating
that the sync formula should be invoked again to get a next page of results. Sync functions
are called repeatedly until there is no continuation returned.
