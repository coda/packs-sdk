# Interface: SyncFormulaResult\<K, L, SchemaT, ContextT, PermissionsContextT\>

The return value from the formula that implements a sync table. Each sync formula invocation
returns one reasonable size page of results. The formula may also return a continuation, indicating
that the sync formula should be invoked again to get a next page of results. Sync functions
are called repeatedly until there is no continuation returned.

## Type Parameters

| Type Parameter | Default type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `K` *extends* `string` | - |
| `L` *extends* `string` | - |
| `SchemaT` *extends* [`ObjectSchemaDefinition`](ObjectSchemaDefinition.md)\<`K`, `L`\> | - |
| `ContextT` *extends* [`SyncExecutionContext`](SyncExecutionContext.md)\<`any`\> | [`SyncExecutionContext`](SyncExecutionContext.md) |
| `PermissionsContextT` *extends* `SyncPassthroughData` | `SyncPassthroughData` |

## Properties

### completion?

> `optional` **completion**: [`SyncCompletionMetadataResult`](../type-aliases/SyncCompletionMetadataResult.md)\<`NonNullable`\<`ContextT`\[`"sync"`\]\[`"previousCompletion"`\]\>\[`"incrementalContinuation"`\]\>

Used to provide additional metadata at the end of a completed sync. It's primarily used to setup incremental sync.

This is ignored if there is also a [continuation](#continuation) on this object.

#### See

[Incremental sync guide]({{ config.site_url }}agents/indexing/incremental/)

***

### continuation?

> `optional` **continuation**: `ContextT`\[`"sync"`\]\[`"continuation"`\]

A marker indicating where the next sync formula invocation should pick up to get the next page of results.
The contents of this object are entirely of your choosing. Sync formulas are called repeatedly
until there is no continuation returned.

***

### deletedRowIds?

> `optional` **deletedRowIds**: `string`[]

The IDs of the rows that have been deleted, as discovered during an incremental sync. The IDs provided should match
the values in the [ObjectSchemaDefinition#idProperty](ObjectSchemaDefinition.md#idproperty) field of the schema.

#### See

[Incremental sync guide]({{ config.site_url }}agents/indexing/incremental/#deleted-records)

***

### result

> **result**: `ObjectSchemaDefinitionType`\<`K`, `L`, `SchemaT`\>[]

The list of rows from this page.
