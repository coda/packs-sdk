# Interface: Fetcher

A utility that allows you to make HTTP requests from a pack. The fetcher also
handles applying user authentication credentials to each request, if applicable.

This is only way a pack is able to make HTTP requests, as using other libraries is unsupported.

## Methods

### fetch()

> **fetch**\<`T`\>(`request`): `Promise`\<[`FetchResponse`](FetchResponse.md)\<`T`\>\>

Makes an HTTP request.

If authentication is used with this pack, the user's secret credentials will be
automatically applied to the request (whether in the HTTP headers, as a URL parameter,
or whatever the authentication type dictates). Your invocation of `fetch()` need not
deal with authentication in any way, Coda will handle that entirely on your behalf.

#### Type Parameters

##### T

`T` = `any`

#### Parameters

##### request

[`FetchRequest`](FetchRequest.md)

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`FetchResponse`](FetchResponse.md)\<`T`\>\>
