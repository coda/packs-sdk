# Function: generateSchema()

> **generateSchema**(`obj`): [`Schema`](../type-aliases/Schema.md)

Utility that examines a JavaScript value and attempts to infer a schema definition
that describes it.

It is vastly preferable to define a schema manually. A clear and accurate schema is one of the
fundamentals of a good pack. However, for data that is truly dynamic for which a schema can't
be known in advance nor can a function be written to generate a dynamic schema from other
inputs, it may be useful to us this helper to sniff the return value and generate a basic
inferred schema from it.

This utility does NOT attempt to determine [ObjectSchemaDefinition.idProperty](../interfaces/ObjectSchemaDefinition.md#idproperty) or
[ObjectSchemaDefinition.displayProperty](../interfaces/ObjectSchemaDefinition.md#displayproperty) attributes for
an object schema, those are left undefined.

## Parameters

### obj

[`InferrableTypes`](../type-aliases/InferrableTypes.md)

## Returns

[`Schema`](../type-aliases/Schema.md)
