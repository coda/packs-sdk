> **getEffectivePropertyKeysFromSchema**(`schema`): `string`[] \| `undefined`

A helper to extract properties fromKeys from a schema object. This is mostly useful
in processing the context.sync.schema in a sync formula, where the schema would only
include a subset of properties which were manually selected by the Pack user.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `schema` | [`Schema`](../type-aliases/Schema.md) |

## Returns

`string`[] \| `undefined`
