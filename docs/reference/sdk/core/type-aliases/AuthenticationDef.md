# Type Alias: AuthenticationDef

> **AuthenticationDef** = [`NoAuthentication`](../interfaces/NoAuthentication.md) \| `VariousAuthentication` \| `AllowedAuthenticationDef`

The union of supported authentication definitions. These represent simplified configurations
a pack developer can specify when calling [PackDefinitionBuilder.setUserAuthentication](../classes/PackDefinitionBuilder.md#setuserauthentication) when using
a pack definition builder. The builder massages these definitions into the form of
an [Authentication](Authentication.md) value, which is the value Coda ultimately cares about.
