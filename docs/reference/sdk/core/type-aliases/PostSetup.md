# Type Alias: PostSetup

> **PostSetup** = [`SetEndpoint`](../interfaces/SetEndpoint.md)

Definitions for optional steps that can happen upon a user completing setup
for a new account for this pack.

This addresses only a highly-specific use case today but may grow to other
use cases and step types in the future.
