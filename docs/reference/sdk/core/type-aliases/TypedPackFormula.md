# Type Alias: TypedPackFormula

> **TypedPackFormula** = [`Formula`](Formula.md) \| [`GenericSyncFormula`](GenericSyncFormula.md)

The union of types that represent formula definitions, including standard formula definitions,
metadata formulas, and the formulas that implement sync tables.

It should be very uncommon to need to use this type, it is most common in meta analysis of the
contents of a pack for Coda internal use.
