# Type Alias: UserAuthenticationDef

> **UserAuthenticationDef** = [`AuthenticationDef`](AuthenticationDef.md) & `object`

A full definition of a pack's user authentication settings, used in
[PackDefinitionBuilder.setUserAuthentication](../classes/PackDefinitionBuilder.md#setuserauthentication).

## Type Declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `defaultConnectionRequirement?` | [`ConnectionRequirement`](../enumerations/ConnectionRequirement.md) | It can be annoying to set `connectionRequirement` on every building block in a Pack. Use this setting in your Pack's auth settings to quickly say "every building block in this Pack requires an account". Without a connectionRequirement, building blocks will be assumed to not need account connections. |
