# Enumeration: TokenExchangeCredentialsLocation

Where to pass the client credentials (client ID and client secret) when making the OAuth2 token
exchange request. Used in [OAuth2Authentication.credentialsLocation](../interfaces/OAuth2Authentication.md#credentialslocation).

## Enumeration Members

### AuthorizationHeader

> **AuthorizationHeader**: `"AuthorizationHeader"`

The credentials are passed in the Authorization header using the `Basic` scheme.

***

### Automatic

> **Automatic**: `"Automatic"`

Allow Coda to determine this automatically. Currently that means Coda tries passing the
credentials in the body first, and if that fails then tries passing them in the Authorization
header.

***

### Body

> **Body**: `"Body"`

The credentials are passed in the body of the request, encoded as
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` along with the other parameters.
