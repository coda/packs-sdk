# Function: executeSyncFormula

[testing](../modules/testing.md).executeSyncFormula

▸ **executeSyncFormula**(`packDef`, `syncFormulaName`, `params`, `context?`, `«destructured»?`, `«destructured»?`): `Promise`<[`GenericSyncFormulaResult`](../types/core.GenericSyncFormulaResult.md)\>

Executes multiple iterations of a sync formula in a loop until there is no longer
a `continuation` returned, aggregating each page of results and returning an array
with results of all iterations combined and flattened.

NOTE: This currently runs all the iterations in a simple loop, which does not
adequately simulate the fact that in a real execution environment each iteration
will be run in a completely isolated environment, with absolutely no sharing
of state or global variables between iterations.

For now, use `coda execute --vm` to simulate that level of isolation.
