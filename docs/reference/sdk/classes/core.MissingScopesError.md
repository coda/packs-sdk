# Class: MissingScopesError

[core](../modules/core.md).MissingScopesError

Throw this error if the user needs to re-authenticate to gain OAuth scopes that have been added
to the pack since their connection was created, or scopes that are specific to a certain formula.
This is useful because Coda will always attempt to execute a formula even if a user has not yet
re-authenticated with all relevant scopes.

You don't *always* need to throw this specific error, as Coda will interpret a 403 (Forbidden)
status code error as a MissingScopesError when the user's connection was made without all
currently relevant scopes. This error exists because that default behavior is insufficient if
the OAuth service does not set a 403 status code (the OAuth spec doesn't specifically require
them to, after all).

**`Example`**

```ts
try {
  let response = context.fetcher.fetch({
    // ...
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Determine if the error is due to missing scopes.
  if (error.statusCode == 400 && error.body?.message.includes("permission")) {
    throw new coda.MissingScopesError();
  }
  // Else handle or throw the error as normal.
}
```
